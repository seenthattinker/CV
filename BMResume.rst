Summary
-------

I advocate open source for everything. I have worked on almost every
system of content production available. I prefer the simple and direct
approach of Markdown these days. My preferred operating system is Linux.
I excel at standalone projects where the client has no existing
methodology. In this space I can create excellent single source
documentation for web, Docx, ODT, or PDF.

Avid reader and accomplished creative writer with two novels in ten
