Summary
-------

I advocate open source for everything.
I have worked on almost every system of content production available.
I prefer the simple and direct approach of Markdown these days.
My preferred operating system is Linux.
I excel at standalone projects where the client has no existing methodology.
In this space I can create excellent single source documentation for web, Docx, ODT, or PDF. 

I believe the latest collaboration technology like GitHub makes working on documents a community activity, with the development teams commenting and editing and the technical writer crafting the final product with clean prose and information architecture.
